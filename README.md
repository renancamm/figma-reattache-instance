# Reattach Instance (Figma Plugin)
Relink a frame to a component by searching for similar instances.

## Use cases:
- Copying a nested component
- Moving the master component to a different file
- Turning a set of similar frames into a component
- Turning detached instances back into instances

Get it here: https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/741415678427267506/Reattach-Instance


## How it works:
1. Select frames (that used to be instances)
2. Click "Plugin/Reattach instance"
3. Plugin finds instances or master components with the same name
4. New instance is created for each corresponding frame
5. The selected frames are replaced by instances ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ‘‰ *NEW:* Overrides will now be applied to instances!

## Known problems:
- Relies too much on layer naming
- Needs to have an instance/master as a reference on the same file
- Doesn't work all the time with team libraries

Feel free to contribute ðŸ˜…
